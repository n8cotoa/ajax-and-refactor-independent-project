E-commerce site. Uses `bcrypt` and `materialize`. There's a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions, I'll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.

To set up:

* Clone to your machine
* Run 'Bundle install' in terminal in the project directory
* Run 'rails db:create'
* Run 'rails db:migrate'
* Run 'rails db:seed' to populate database with fake data
